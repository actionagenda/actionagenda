When your to-do list gets bigger and complex, you need more than a simple check list.  
You’ll want to organize them so that you know what to do next.  
You'll want to schedule it to be a calendar event if needed.  
You’ll want to overview those items on the same page.

4. Mark which ones need attention (drag it to “Focus” tab or mark star)
5. Make use of context and tag for further categorizing (drag it to “Context”, “Tag” tab)
6. Schedule it if it has a hard due date (drag it to “Scheduled” tab)
