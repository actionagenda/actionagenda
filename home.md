## 🚧 "We are unable to support the app anymore and we thank you for using ActionAgenda"
-------

When your to-do list gets bigger and complex, you need more than a simple check list.  
You’ll want to organize them so that you know what to do next.  
You'll want to schedule it to be a calendar event if needed.  
You’ll want to overview those items on the same page.  
  
ActionAgenda is a hybrid calendar and to-do planner based on GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology which can free you from the stress of managing complex tasks.

### Here’s short how-tos on using GTD with ActionAgenda:

1. Put whatever comes to your mind in “Inbox” tab
2. Do simple actionable stuffs right away (tap on checkbox to complete)
3. Make not-so-simple stuffs as project and break it down to smaller steps (drag it to “Project” tab)
4. Mark which ones need attention (drag it to “Focus” tab or mark star)
5. Make use of context and tag for further categorizing (drag it to “Context”, “Tag” tab)
6. Schedule it if it has a hard due date (drag it to “Scheduled” tab)
7. Make an appointment by drag & dropping to “Calendar”
8. Don’t forget to review regularly to keep your trusted system current, so that you know when, where, and how they can be done fast and easily.
