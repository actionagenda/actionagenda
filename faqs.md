**<a name="a1"></a>◆ I cannot add Reminders to-do or project**

> iOS Reminders app(sub system) is not initialized yet.
>
> Please try the following:
> 
> 1. Enable iCloud reminders in Settings.app -> iCloud -> Reminders toggle to “ON”
> 2. Open Reminders.app -> add new list
> 3. Go to Settings.app -> Reminders -> Default list -> change it to new list
> 4. Restart your device (completely power cycle it)

**<a name="a2"></a>◆ How do I sync Reminders to-dos from my iPhone to iPad (context, tag, etc.)?**

> You can sync extra info such as context, tag, star or manual sorting order like following:
>
> In your iPhone, ActionAgenda Settings > Sync > Reminders Sync > turn on “Sync extra info”
> This will make future items’ extra info in sync.
> 
> To make all current items in sync, use “Add Extra Info” button below.
> 
> If you have many reminders to-dos, open iOS Reminders app in iPad to force speeding up the sync.
> 
> After sync from iPhone to iPad is finished, turn on “Sync extra info” in the iPad as well. Reminders sync is enabled for both ways now.

**<a name="a3"></a>◆ Weather information is empty or inaccurate**

> Weather data is provided by openweathermap.org which is a free service and their coverage and accuracy varies by location.
>
> If you are not seeing the weather data, try other nearby city or street address.

**<a name="a4"></a>◆ How can I sync iOS calendar with Google calendar?**

> To sync iOS calendar with Google calendar, please refer to following guides from Google :
>

**<a name="a5"></a>◆ I don’t see any calendar events in iOS 6**

> If you have accidentally denied access request to calendar, you can enable it in:  
> iOS settings app > Privacy > Calendars > turn on ActionAgenda

**<a name="a6"></a>◆ How can I sync my to-dos with Toodledo?**

> You can register at [Toodledo website](http://www.toodledo.com/) and enter Toodledo email login and password in settings page of ActionAgenda.

**<a name="a7"></a>◆ What is GTD?**

> Getting things done (GTD) is a method created by David Allen and focuses on freeing up one’s mind and putting stuffs in a trusted system which can act as an external assistance.
> 
> For more information on GTD, please refer to the following wikipedia page :
> 
> [Getting Things Done – Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)

**<a name="a8"></a>◆ Does ActionAgenda support sub to-dos or outlining?**

> Yes. It supports sub to-dos and to-do outlining in <u><b>Project tab</b></u>.
> 
> Little button on the left side of text entry toggles sub to-do entry mode.
> 
> Tapping “Edit” in the upper right corner to enter edit mode where you can change order or indent/outdent to-dos.
> 
> Sub to-dos and outlining is supported only when to-dos in Project are <u><b>sorted manually</b></u>, so make sure to check it (using 2nd button on toolbar)
> 
> ActionAgenda’s to-do outlining works independently from Toodledo sub to-do, so pro account is not needed.

**<a name="a9"></a>◆ I am only seeing this month’s events in calendar. What should I do to see all my events?**

> Go to iOS Settings > mail, contacts, calendars > calendars sync
> and change sync to “All Events”

> 
> Or you can delete selected to-dos by tapping on “Edit” > select to-dos > “Action” > “Delete”

**<a name="a12"></a>◆ I don’t see all repeating to-dos in calendar**

> Unlike events, next repeating to-do will show up when current to-do is completed.

**<a name="a13"></a>◆ Is there any way to sync to-dos with Outlook?**

> There is a way to sync to-dos with Outlook, but not directly with ActionAgenda.
> ActionAgenda syncs with Toodledo, and there are tools which can sync Toodledo with Outlook,
> or you could export/import to-dos to/from Outlook:
